A cutting-edge complaint registration system leveraging YOLOv5 algorithm, performed an in-depth analysis to detect and resolve service issues and bolstering public confidence and improving overall government-citizen interactions. 


The ordinary people who fall under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation must have the freedom to express their requirements and demands from the government and being a responsible citizen of the country one must be able to voluntarily report his or her concerns regarding day-to-day problems.

Pothole Grievance Reporting System is web-based application which enables citizens to register their concerns and will allow municipal authorities to overcome the hurdles efficiently and meet their expectations. This system provides a user-friendly interface for reporting complaints, allowing citizens to voice their concerns and follow their progress.

# Scope
Advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning have enabled sophisticated technologies for analyzing, scoring, and visualizing customer complaints and feedback. These technologies leverage advanced lexical and syntax analysis algorithms to determine the subject matter and context of a complaint.
In the digital age, reputation management technologies have emerged to measure and manage brand image. These technologies treat complaints as a valuable source for improving customer satisfaction, products/services, and organizational processes. Reputation management encompasses a broader scope than just complaints, encompassing various forms of online posts and interactions.
Notably, fewer customers today submit formal complaints via mail or letters. Instead, they tend to share negative experiences immediately on social media platforms, potentially causing significant business impacts. Advanced NLP algorithms can assess the level of dissatisfaction expressed in a complaint and identify the specific context or subject matter.
Furthermore, these technologies enable organizations to gain a comprehensive view of complaints, including geographical breakdowns, customer profiles, and trends over time. This holistic perspective empowers data-driven decision-making and targeted improvements based on customer feedback.
